# Calculate Shock Response Spectrum (SRS) using Smallwood Ramp Invariant Recursive Method

This python library can be used to calculate and plot Shock Response Spectrum (SRS) from accelerometer data (acceleration in g's vs time in seconds)

Notes:
- Cubeloop uses Python 3.6, installed from Anaconda
    - Ideally, install miniconda and only install libraries that you need using "conda install" or "pip install"
    - With Anaconda you can create and manage virtual environments
